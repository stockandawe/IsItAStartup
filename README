A simple Q&A bot that helps you evaluate if you should launch a startup based on your idea. 

Note: 
- Probably valid only for web startups.
- I think you will need ruby installed to run the script, but what do I know. 
- The code is the result of my limited knowledge in ruby and not an accurate representation of my coding skills. 
  - I wrote this in about 20 minutes 
  - In the spirit of 'lean startup' I was more intersted in 'validated learning' rather than "releasing" the perfect product.
